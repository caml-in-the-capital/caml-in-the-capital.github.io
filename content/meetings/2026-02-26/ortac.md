title: "Dynamic Verification of OCaml Software with ORTAC/QCheck-STM"

In this talk I would like to introduce the QCheck-STM plugin for ORTAC,
a framework for dynamic verification of OCaml code. ORTAC/QCheck-STM
consumes OCaml module signatures annotated with contracts expressed in
the Gospel language and generates code for automated runtime assertion
checking from it. I will highlight some details of the implementation of
the tool, the structure of the generated code, and on errors found in
established OCaml libraries.
